# Sample webapplication

This application requires MongoDB.

### For local development
1. Intall mongodb locally if it is not done already
2. Start mongod instance (make sure it is not running already: ps -ef|grep mongo)
3. Make sure that you are pointing to correct mongo instance by looking at application.properties or application-override.properties

Good Luck!
